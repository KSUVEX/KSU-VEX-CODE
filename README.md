## development instructions
when we give a task to be done a **BRANCH** will be created, if u were assigned to do the task,
u **FETCH** and modify the code **INSIDE THE ASSIGNED BRANCH ONLY** and not in any other branches or the main one.

when u finish a task u first make a quick summery of what u did then a discreption of your name and the task u did inside github desktop
then commit it to your assigned branch then **PUSH TO ORIGIN** and ask for a **PULLREQUEST**

**DO NOT MERGE TO THE MAIN BRANCH**
